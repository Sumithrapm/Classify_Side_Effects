# Classify_Side_Effects
For most diseases, drug therapy enhances health-related quality of life. However, inappropriate use of drugs may be harmful and could evoke side effects. This study aimed to build a classification model that can classify side effects of particular drugs by gender, age, and race.
It is possible to extract drug reactions from user reviews on the Web, and the automated treatment of this information paves the way for personalized medicine and widespread drug testing. In medical applications, demographic information about the user can be extracted.
Most patient demographics include the following: Full legal name, Date of birth, Biological sex,Gender,Contact information, including address,Ethnicity,Race
As part of this work, we make the first steps towards extracting demographic information from user-generated texts related to medical topics. I have collected databases of medical reviews from health-related Web sites with user-generated content, namely WebMD. This dataset is available in kaggle.
WebMD provides health-related information, support, and reference materials through a team of doctors and health experts across a wide array of specialties.
The dataset provides user reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions, side effects, age, sex, and ratings reflecting overall patient satisfaction. There are around 0.36 million rows of unique reviews.
